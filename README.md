# LAS
The multi-distro app store

## Installing
As this is a pre-alpha, this README will be short, and will only cover installation steps for Debian-based systems. Support for other systems will come soon.

Node.js is required to package LAS.


```
git clone https://github.com/User8395/las.git
cd las
npm install
npm run make
```

The `.deb` package will then be located in the `out/` folder.

## Development
LAS development just started, so it might take a while for the first public beta to be released.
